            <li><h4>What is an Anchor Tag?</h4></li>
            An Anchor tag is a tag used to link different web pages internally or externally.<br>
            An example of an anchor tag is the opening tag < a href="" ></a> <br>
            <li><h4>What are Block elements?</h4></li>
            Block elements are the elements that fills the whole line. All the headings are block elements.<br>
            Image tags < img >, Div < Div >, Ordered list < ol > are all block elements.  
        </ol>
            

            <ul>
            <li><h4>What distinguishes Normal HTML elements from Semantic HTML elements?</h4></li>
            The distinguhing factor between normal HTML elements from Semantic HTML elements is the meaning and context they convey. <br>
            Semantic HTML elements clearly describes its meaning, and defines its content to the browser and the developer. E.g < header >,< article > and < footer >.<br>
            Whereas the normal HTML elements are the elements that tells us nothing about its content. They're  mainly used to structure and styling. E.g < div >, < span >.
            
            <li><h4>Explain the disparity between Closing tags and Self-closing tags in HTML.</h4></li>
            A self-closing tag is a tag that does not need a closing tag separately, and cannot have other elements or tags in it. E.g < img >, < br >, < link >, etc. <br>
            On the other hand, closing tags are are those tags that has a separate closing tag and can have other elements or tags in it. E.g < /p >, < /li >, < /head >, etc.

            <li><h4>What distinguishes Inline elements from Block elements in HTML?</h4></li>
            Inline elements do not start in a new line but continues in the same line when more content is added, but block elements always start in a line. <br>
            Inline elements allow other inline elements to sit behind, but block elements does not allow other elelemts to sit behind. <br>
            Inline elelemts are used for styling or to format specific parts of a content, that is why they do not start on a new line (E.g < span >, < a href >), but <br>
            the block elements are used to structure the main content of a webpage, that is why they start on a new line (E.g < div >, < p >, < ul >).
